## 🧠 **PRICING PSYCHOLOGY**

### **Anchor High:**
Always present Premium first, then Pro, then Starter.

**Wrong:**
> "I have a basic package for $500..."

**Right:**
> "I have three options. Most businesses go with Premium at $2000, which includes everything plus managed service. But I also have Pro at $1000 if you want to manage it yourself. And Starter at $500 if you just want the basics."

### **Justify with ROI:**
Never say the price without showing the value.

**Example:**
> "The Pro package is $1000. If it prevents just 5 no-shows this month at $100 each, it paid for itself. And most clients see 10-15 fewer no-shows. Plus you'll get more reviews, which brings in new customers. So realistically, you'll make this back in 2-3 weeks."

### **Create Urgency:**
> "I can install this week. After that, I'm booked for 3 weeks."

### **Social Proof:**
> "I just did this for [similar business] down the street. They've seen [specific result]."

---

## 💬 **PRICING OBJECTION HANDLERS**

### **Objection: "That's expensive."**

**Response:**
> "I get it - it's an investment. Let me ask: how many no-shows do you get per month? And what's the average appointment value?"
> 
> [They say: "Maybe 10 no-shows, $80 average"]
> 
> "So that's $800/month in lost revenue just from no-shows. This system reduces that by 50-70%. That's $400-$560 saved every month. So it pays for itself in the first month, and then it's pure profit after that."

### **Objection: "Can I think about it?"**

**Response:**
> "Of course! What questions do you have? I want to make sure you have all the info."
> 
> [Address concerns]
> 
> "Tell you what - I can hold a spot for you this week, but after Friday I'm booked for the next 3 weeks. Want me to pencil you in?"

### **Objection: "Can't I just do this myself?"**

**Response:**
> "You could! But here's the thing: I've already built all the templates, tested everything, and optimized the messages. It would take you 20-30 hours to figure it all out, debug issues, write messages, etc. Your time is worth more than that. I can have you up and running in 2 hours."

### **Objection: "I need to ask my business partner."**

**Response:**
> "Makes sense! What would they need to know to say yes? I can hop on a quick call with both of you, or I can send you a breakdown to share with them."

### **Objection: "I'm not sure I need all this."**

**Response:**
> "That's fair. Let me ask: what's your biggest pain point right now? No-shows? Not enough reviews? Forgetting to follow up with leads?"
> 
> [They tell you]
> 
> "Perfect - we can focus on solving that first. Let me customize a package that addresses exactly what you need."

## 🎁 **DEAL SWEETENERS** (When They're on the Fence)

### **Fast Decision Bonus:**
> "If you decide today, I'll include [add-on] for free ($300 value)."

### **Referral Incentive:**
> "Refer another business, and I'll give you both 20% off."

### **Pay Upfront Discount:**
> "Pay in full today and save $200."

### **Bundle Deal:**
> "Have another location? I'll do both for $1500 total instead of $2000."

---

## 📊 **REVENUE MODELING**

### **Conservative (2 installs/week):**
```
2 installs × $1000 avg = $2,000/week
$2,000 × 4 weeks = $8,000/month
```

### **Moderate (4 installs/week):**
```
4 installs × $1000 avg = $4,000/week
$4,000 × 4 weeks = $16,000/month
```

### **Aggressive (8 installs/week):**
```
8 installs × $1000 avg = $8,000/week
$8,000 × 4 weeks = $32,000/month
```

### **With Recurring Revenue:**
```
32 active clients × $300/month managed = $9,600/month recurring
+ $16,000 installation revenue
= $25,600/month total
```

## 🎯 **CLOSING SCRIPT**

### **After Demo:**

> "So what do you think? Can you see this working for your business?"
> 
> [They say yes]
> 
> "Awesome! I have three packages..."
> 
> [Explain packages, starting with Premium]
> 
> "Most businesses in [their niche] go with Pro because it includes the review automation, which typically brings in 5-10 new customers per month. But I also have Premium if you want full-service, or Starter if you want to start simple."
> 
> "Which one feels like the best fit?"
> 
> [They choose]
>

> 
> [They agree]
> 
> "Great! I'll send you an invoice for a $500 deposit to hold your spot. Once you pay that, you're locked in."
>
