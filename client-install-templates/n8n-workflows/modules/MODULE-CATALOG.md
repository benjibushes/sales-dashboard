## 📊 **SALES APPROACH**

### **The Modular Pitch:**

> "You don't have to do everything at once. Let's start with what hurts most.
>
> What's your biggest pain point right now?
> - Missing leads? → Auto-Reply ($200)
> - No-shows? → Appointment Reminders ($300)
> - Need reviews? → Review Automation ($250)
> - Lost customers? → Reactivation ($350)
>
> We can install it in 15-20 minutes and you'll see results today.
>
> If you love it, we add more modules later. If not, you're only out $200-350.
>
> Most clients start with one module, then add 2-3 more within 30 days because they see the ROI immediately."

2. OR **Appointment Reminders** - If they have no-shows

### **Best Upsell Combinations:**

- Client wants "everything free"
- Client wants custom messages (upsell to suite)
- Client has no existing customer base
- Client won't track data in Airtable

### **Green Lights (Sell Modules):**
- "Let's start small and see results"
- "I just need [one thing] fixed first"
- "What's the quickest win?"
- Budget-conscious but motivated
