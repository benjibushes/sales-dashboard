## 🎥 **RECORDED TRAINING VIDEO SCRIPT** (Record on Loom)

**Duration: 5-7 minutes**

### **Intro (30 sec)**
"Hey [Client Name]! This is Ben. I just finished setting up your automation system and wanted to leave you this quick training video so you can refer back to it anytime."

### **Part 1: What's Automated (1 min)**
[Screen record Airtable dashboard]

"Let me show you what's happening automatically. Open your Airtable dashboard at this link [show link].

You'll see three main tabs:
1. Customers - everyone who's ever contacted you
2. Appointments - all scheduled appointments
3. Messages - every text message sent/received

Everything is logged automatically. You don't have to do anything - the system handles it."

### **Part 2: How Automations Work (2 min)**
[Show example workflow in n8n OR just explain verbally]

"Here's what happens behind the scenes:

**When someone calls and you don't answer:**
- They automatically get a text: 'Hi! We missed your call...'
- Their number gets saved to your Customers table
- You can call them back when you're ready

**The day before an appointment:**
- At 9am, your customer gets a reminder text
- It includes their appointment time and date
- If they need to reschedule, they can just text back

**After a completed appointment:**
- A few hours later, they get a review request
- This helps you get more Google reviews
- More reviews = more new customers!

**If someone hasn't visited in 60+ days:**
- They automatically get a friendly 'we miss you' text
- With a special offer to come back
- This brings back old customers!"

### **Part 3: How to Use Airtable (2 min)**
[Screen record clicking through Airtable]

"Let me show you the most important things:

**To view today's appointments:**
1. Click 'Appointments' tab
2. Click 'Calendar' view
3. You'll see everything for the week

**To add a new customer manually:**
1. Click 'Customers' tab
2. Click the + button
3. Add their name, phone, and email
4. That's it!

**To book an appointment:**
1. Click 'Appointments' tab
2. Click + button
3. Select the customer from the dropdown
4. Add date, time, and service
5. Save - they'll automatically get a confirmation text!

**To see message history:**
1. Click 'Messages' tab
2. You can see every text sent and received
3. Searchable and sortable"

### **Part 4: What NOT to Do (30 sec)**
[Screen record showing the checkbox fields]

"Important things NOT to touch:

See these checkboxes that say 'Reminder Sent' and 'Review Requested'? Don't uncheck these - they prevent duplicate messages.

Also, don't delete any fields or columns. If you want to add something, that's fine, but don't remove anything.

And don't share your Airtable access with anyone unless you trust them completely."

### **Part 5: Support & Wrap-Up (1 min)**
[Back to your face on camera]

"That's it! Your system is live and working.

If you have ANY questions, just text me at [your number]. I'm here to help.

I'll check in with you in 7 days to make sure everything is running smoothly.

In the meantime, watch the magic happen! You're about to see way more reviews, fewer no-shows, and better customer communication.
